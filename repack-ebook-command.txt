# Without -X you could get the following when validating it with EpubCheck:
# ERROR: my.epub: Mimetype entry must not have an extra field in its ZIP header
# If mimetype is not the first in the epub file EpubCheck prints the following:
# ERROR: my.epub: Mimetype entry missing or not the first in archive
# The -0 flag makes sure that the mimetype file doesn't get compressed, which is also necessary 
# for the mimetype file to work as a magical number, otherwise the data at the position where the mimetype 
# file is expected could be compressed, scrambled gibberish.
