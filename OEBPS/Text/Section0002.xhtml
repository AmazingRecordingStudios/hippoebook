	<p id="linguisticNote">-ων: GEN pl; <br/>ἑκὰς + GEN: "far from";<br/>ἀνδρῶν: "men";<br/>ἀλφηστάων: industrious, enterprising. Originally might have literally meant "one who eats bread", a composite from ἄλφι (flour) and the suffix -ησ-τής, "eater", and by extension meant "one who earns his daily bread, his food", therefore "the worker" and consequently "the active, the industrious"</p>
