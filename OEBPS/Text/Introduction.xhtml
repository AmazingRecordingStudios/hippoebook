<p>Discover famous quotes and hear them spoken in Ancient Greek.
Selection of quotes, grouped by grammatical or linguistic topics. There are some to get accustomed to nouns and adjective declensions, some for prepositions, etcetera.</p>

<p>The idea is to take advantage of the natural learning process of a language, through the hearing, which is the most effective way of memorization. The visualization of the text solidifies the understanding of the words heard.</p>

<p>In the longplay section, there is the read along of longer passages, rather than single quotes.</p>

<p>In any case, we are using at the same time the audiobook feature and the ebook feature, which are usually taken separately.</p>

<p>This is a work in progress, both in the selection of quotes and the availability of the voice recordings of them. That is why we encourage everyone interested, including beginners to Greek, to join and contribute to the project, by proposing quotes and passages that they like, and ..join in and experiment by recording themselves while reading any passage they like, and sending it to us.
We think it’s best when no particular prescription of ..pronunciation room is strictly followed (considering those are reconstructed approximations anyway), but rather, and more interestingly, read by given your own interpretation of the passage.</p>

<p>The project stemmed from the author’s own need to learn Greek, and realizing there were no resources to learn it the way he wanted, by hearing it spoken.</p>
