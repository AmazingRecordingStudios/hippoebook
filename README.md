*Hippo audiobook* is a collection of marvelous Ancient Greek quotes that you can __hear spoken in the Ancient Greek original__ (for the audios, the only ebook reader currently supported is Adobe digital editions).

The quotes, ranging __from Homer to Plutarch__, are grouped by topic, and start from minimal very short phrases to longer passages. For each you can see a translation, the reference to the original author and work, and some linguistic notes.

This is released as a beta prototype and it's a __collaborative open project__. We welcome anyone to __send us__ their recordings and to suggest their favourite Ancient Greek quotes and passages.

The project stemmed from the authorsâ€™ own wish to learn Greek, and realizing that there were no resources to learn it the way they wanted, by hearing it spoken. We think that, as a side effect, a project like this could broaden the potential audience interested in Ancient Greek, by making it more accessible.
